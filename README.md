# helloos
pintos

helloos is a repo I use to impelement some opreating system labs. master branch is about cs162-fa21, I'm trying to impelement it using a docker image from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/seydockerlitz/mypintos_cs162/.  branch is also cs162, but using vagrant and virtualbox on a specific x86 computer, just like the cs162' s intro doc revealed.
