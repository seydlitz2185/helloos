# helloos
pintos

helloos is a repo I use to impelement some opreating system labs. master branch is about cs162-fa21, I'm trying to impelement it on a M1 MacBook Air, using a docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/loeper/stanford-cs212-pintos x86 branch is also cs162, but using vagrant and virtualbox on a specific x86 computer, just like the cs162' s intro doc revealed.
